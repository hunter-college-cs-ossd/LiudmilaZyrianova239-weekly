## October 10th, [Assignment 6](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_06_team_project.pdf):  Collaborative Editing
The collaborative editing was a great task to understand the merge technique better. The most interesting part, for sure, was the merge conflict and the ways to resolve it. Also, I've found out that command `git fetch` works worse than `git pull`.

## October 10th, [Assignment 7](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_07_readings.pdf):  Readings on Open Source
It was a very interesting reading which provided a deeper understanding of the OSSD world. 
* [A Beginner's Very Bumpy Journey Through The World of Open Source by Shubheksha Jalan](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginners-very-bumpy-journey-through-the-world-of-open-source-4d108d540b39) was the most useful, because it reveals a very actual problem for me - the fear of asking the questions. Her text gave me some kind of confidence in myself because she was also the kind of person, who  had the same problem, like me. She motivated me to seek help, if needed, and to find mentors, who are ready to help. Also, she raised a very important note that the project I want to contribute must have a friendly cooperating environment.
* However, the most useful article for me was [GitHub's Giude](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/). It is just the best article I could ever imagine about how to contribute to the Open Sourse Project. It has everything the beginner may need: the motivational advice, the links to the websites with Open Source projects issues, and the ways to contribute (even though the amount of suggested ways is smaller than in the article [How to Contribute to Open Source Without Coding](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/), they are less bazaar, hence, better for me). More than that, thanks to the article, I've found a super useful [list of potential interview questions for front-end developer candidates](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions). Also, the article contains the very useful tips on how to choose the project, how it is organized, and which steps I should follow to make a contribution.
So, if I was asked to choose the most useful and necessary article about the Open SourCe, I would choose this one.

PS: Sorry for completing this blog post later. I didn't know the deadline for this blog post since the assignment didn't explicitly say so.
