## October 10th, [Assignment 6](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_06_team_project.pdf):  Collaborative Editing
The collaborative editing was a great task to understand the merge technique better. The most interesting part, for sure, was the merge conflict and the ways to resolve it. Also, I've found out that command `git fetch` works worse than `git pull`.

## October 10th, [Assignment 7](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_07_readings.pdf):  Readings on Open Source
It was a very interesting reading which provided a deeper understanding of the OSSD world. [A Beginner's Very Bumpy Journey Through The World of Open Source by Shubheksha Jalan](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginners-very-bumpy-journey-through-the-world-of-open-source-4d108d540b39) was the most useful, because it reveals a very actual problem for me - the fear of asking the questions. Her text gave me some kind of confidence in myself because she was also the kind of person, who  had the same problem, like me. She motivated me to seek help, if needed, and to find mentors, who are ready to help.
