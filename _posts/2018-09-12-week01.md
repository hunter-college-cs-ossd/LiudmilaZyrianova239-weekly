## September 5th, [Assignment 1](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/openstreetmap_assignment.pdf): OpenStreetMaps, README.md
By September 5th I've followed the instructions from `README.md`, and changed the `_config.yml`, `about.md`, and `README.md` files. 

Also I've edited the map from [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org). You can find the history of my changes [here]( https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/LiudmilaZyrianova239/history).
I've done the following changes in Stamford, CT:
* Added restaurants such as Flinders Lane, bartaco, Buffalo Wild Wings, Barcelona, Kotobuki, and McDonald's. 
  * I've specified their locations, cuisine, hours, websites, and telephones.
* Added shops such as Burlington and City Furniture Home Decor.
  * I've specified their locations, type of the shop, hours, websites, parking, and telephones.
* Added Social Security Office
  * I've specified its locations, hours, websites, and telephones.
  
## September 12th, [Assignment 2](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_02_readings.pdf): Articles
By September 12th I've changed `about.md`, and tried to fix all of my misspellings in the first blog. I then read the articles from the [Assignment 2](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_02_readings.pdf). The reading was very exciting: I was surprised that “free software” and “open source” are different and competing ideas. It was also good to discover how these two cultures were developed. And I would like to know, what are the approximate percentages of free software and open source with respect to all produced softwares.

### My responses to the questions from the Assignment 2:

* What are three of the most significant things that Richard Stallman has done to advance the rise of the free and open source software movement? 
  1. He started the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF), whose goal was to "develop a completely free and open computer operating system and body of application software, in which users would never be prevented from hacking or from sharing their modifications".
  2. He devised a copyright license - the GNU General Public License (GPL) - whose terms guaranteed that his code would be free. It says that the code "may be copied and modified without restriction, and that both copies and derivative works must be distributed under the same license as the original, with no additional restrictions".
  3. He created a successful project, which drew attention of the technical world. "The GNU text editor (Emacs) and C compiler (GCC) were particularly successful, gaining large and loyal followings not on ideological grounds, but simply on their technical merits".
 
* Eric Raymond identified several key principles in the development of an open source project. There are two that strike me as being particularly insightful or significant:
  1. "2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)".
  I have always thought that the code should be done by my own effort, without using someone else's work. It is good to know that I can apply already developed ideas.
  2. "7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers."
 As it turns out, I shouldn’t seek to do beta-version as much as possible. My customers will do that better and faster than me.
