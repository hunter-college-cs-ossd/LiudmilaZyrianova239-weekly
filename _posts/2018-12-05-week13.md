## December 5th

By December 5th our team, split into 2 teams, has done the following:
  * Both of our teams completed the plan from the [previous week](https://github.com/hunter-college-cs-ossd/LiudmilaZyrianova239-weekly/blob/master/_posts/2018-11-28-week12.md). 
    * We searched for the information about the algorithms, watched some videos, and read the articles to build the correct algorithms. 
    * We cooperated with each to write the correct code and run many various tests, including the corner cases.
  * Now, we switched the issues between the teams, so that the first team checks the code written by the second team and vice versa. We do this in order to find any bugs that haven't been noticed, check whether the code is commented good enough and whether it follows the conventions provided by the project. We hope to make pull requests by the end of Friday or Saturday.
