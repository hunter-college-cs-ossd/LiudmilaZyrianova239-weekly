        > guarantee your freedom to share and change free software–to make sure the software is free for all its users
        
  * How active is this project? Are people actively submitting issues and are people closing issues in a
timely manner?
      * This is a very active project: people actively submit issues (few times per day), pull request and merge them almost every day. 
  * How welcoming does the community seem? Are people friendly in the issue discussions, the discussion
forum, and chat? 
      * The issue discussion on [issues.qgis.org](https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/issues) doesn't seems to be too active. However, they have a great discussions of [Pull Requests on GitHub](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls). The [IRC discussion](http://irclogs.geoapt.com/qgis/) also seens very helpful and friendy 
  * How easy is it to find information about contributing to the project? Are there clear guides and
documentation that can help someone who wants to contribute? Are there written guides about rules
of conduct, for example? In short, is it an inviting project?
      * It is a very inviting project! There are various [guides](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/developers_guide/index.html) for anything you may need. They explain every step for you, even how to name the fuctions and classes.
  * What programming languages are used in the project?
      *  C++ or Python
  * What is the development environment, and how hard is it to download and install it?
      *  IDE is QtCreator. It seems that it is relatively easy to install it. Their guide [*Getting up and running with QtCreator and QGIS*](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/developers_guide/qtcreator.html#setting-your-run-environment) and [*Getting Started*](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/getting_started.html) provides precise information about every step.
  * How hard is it to understand the project code? Is it a large code base?
      * The code is very easy to understand: they have `.h` and `.cpp` files always in pairs, the `.h` is well documented, and `.cpp` is very clear: the variables, classes, etc. are named appropriately, the code is readable. Overall, they have created a great and absolutely accurate code!  
  * Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database or graphics libraries?
      * No, it looks like that you don't need anything other than QGIS and QtCreateor.
  * How much does one need to know about the domain of the application in order to understand the
code? For example, if it is a health-related application, how much medical or biological background
would a contributor need?
      * You don't need to know anything about geography! It's mostly about user's interface and visualization.
  * How complicated is the code and how large is it?
      * It is a very large code! However, it is maintained so good and it is very easy to understand everythiong there!
  * How mature is the project? Is it very new, or has it been around for a long time? Does it have a stable
release yet?
      * The project was born in May of 2002, and it has already released version 2.18. So this project is mature enough.
  * Is the project interesting and/or exciting to you?
      * This Project is very interesting for me! I like the way the authors explain everything, the way the project is designed, and how the comunity cares about it. Also, I really like working with maps. So I think this project is great for me.
