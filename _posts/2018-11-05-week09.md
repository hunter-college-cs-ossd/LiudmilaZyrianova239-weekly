# Quantum GIS (updated on 10/27/2018)

### 1. High Level Project Evaluation Criteria
  * Is it open source?
      * Yes
  * What is its license? Does the license allow for forks and modifications?
      * It has [GNU General Public License](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/appendices/appendices.html#gnu-general-public-license) and [GNU Free Documentation License](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/appendices/appendices.html#gnu-free-documentation-license), which: 
      
        > guarantee your freedom to share and change free software–to make sure the software is free for all its users
        
  * How active is this project? Are people actively submitting issues and are people closing issues in a
timely manner?
      * This is a very active project: people actively submit issues (few times per day), pull request and merge them almost every day. 
  * How welcoming does the community seem? Are people friendly in the issue discussions, the discussion
forum, and chat? 
      * The issue discussion on [issues.qgis.org](https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/issues) doesn't seem to be too active. However, they have great discussions of [Pull Requests on GitHub](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls). The [IRC discussion](http://irclogs.geoapt.com/qgis/) also seems very helpful and friendly. 
  * How easy is it to find information about contributing to the project? Are there clear guides and
documentation that can help someone who wants to contribute? Are there written guides about rules
of conduct, for example? In short, is it an inviting project?
      * It is a very inviting project! There are various [guides](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/developers_guide/index.html) for anything you may need. They explain every step for you, even how to name the functions and classes.
  * What programming languages are used in the project?
      *  C++ or Python
  * What is the development environment, and how hard is it to download and install it?
      *  IDE is QtCreator. It seems that it is relatively easy to install it. Their guide [*Getting up and running with QtCreator and QGIS*](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/developers_guide/qtcreator.html#setting-your-run-environment) and [*Getting Started*](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/getting_started.html) provides precise information about every step.
  * How hard is it to understand the project code? Is it a large code base?
      * The code is very easy to understand: they have `.h` and `.cpp` files always in pairs, the `.h` is well documented, and `.cpp` is very clear: the variables, classes, etc. are named appropriately, the code is readable. Overall, they have created a great and absolutely accurate code!  
  * Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database or graphics libraries?
      * No, it looks like that you don't need anything other than QGIS and QtCreateor.
  * How much does one need to know about the domain of the application in order to understand the
code? For example, if it is a health-related application, how much medical or biological background
would a contributor need?
      * You don't need to know anything about geography! It's mostly about the user's interface and visualization.
  * How complicated is the code and how large is it?
      * It is a very large code! However, it is maintained so well and it is very easy to understand everything there!
  * How mature is the project? Is it very new, or has it been around for a long time? Does it have a stable
release yet?
      * The project was born in May of 2002, and it has already released version 2.18. So this project is mature enough.
  * Is the project interesting and/or exciting to you?
      * This Project is very interesting for me! I like the way the authors explain everything, the way the project is designed, and how the community cares about it. Also, I really like working with maps. So I think this project is great for me.

# Doxygen (updated on 10/28/2018)

### 0. Additional Questions

  * How many lines of code does Doxygen have?
      * Code Lines :	279,317	
  * What percentage of the code is comments?
      * Percent Comment Lines :	15.6%
  * How many commits were made in the last 30 days, based on OpenHub statistics?
      * 43 commits in the last 30 days
  * Click on "User & Contributor Locations" (lower right side of screen). List some of the locations of
the developers.
      * The page hasn't loaded.

### 1. High Level Project Evaluation Criteria
  * Is it open source? 
      * It wasn't said explicitly, but since it has the source code opened, which allows for forks and modifications under GNU General Public Licence, I can assume that it is open source.
  * What is its license? Does the license allow for forks and modifications?
      * It has [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html), which allows for forks and modifications.
  * How active is this project? Are people actively submitting issues and are people closing issues in a
timely manner?
      * This project is active, but it is much less active than *Quantum GIS*. They submit issues irregularly: every 3-7 days. They close issues also very irregularly: it may take either a few days or a few months.
  * How welcoming does the community seem? Are people friendly in the issue discussions, the discussion
forum, and chat?
      * Even though people are friendly, it looks like there is only one person, who does a great job participating in issue discussions and in pull request discussion.
  * How easy is it to find information about contributing to the project? Are there clear guides and
documentation that can help someone who wants to contribute? Are there written guides about rules
of conduct, for example? In short, is it an inviting project?
      * The information is very easy to find, there is a special [Mannual](http://www.doxygen.org/manual/index.html), which describes every step the developer needs to do. However, there are no rules of conduct. So, this project is controversial: on the one hand, it has a super-friendly guide about everything in the project. However, the active and supportive part of the community is not too diverse and vast.
  * What programming languages are used in the project?
      * 87.6% of the code is in C++.
  * What is the development environment, and how hard is it to download and install it?
      * Visual Studio 2013, Cygwin, or MinGW. Also, you need to install modern versions of `bison`, `flex`, `python`, and `binaries`. Also, there are some additional things to install, which depend on developers' goals. There are a lot of things to download, but it looks like it is pretty easy to do. 
  * How hard is it to understand the project code? Is it a large code base?
      * It is a large code base, but because the code has minor comments, it is not so easy to understand it. But it isn't messy, so it is understandable, even though it takes more effort.
  * Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database or graphics libraries?
      * Since Doxygen comes as a self-installing archive, so installation of the binaries is extremely simple.
  * How much does one need to know about the domain of the application in order to understand the
code? For example, if it is a health-related application, how much medical or biological background
would a contributor need?
      * It the developer want to modify parts that document the code, for sure they need to know how to do this. In this case, Doxygen provides some [Articles](http://doxygen.org/articles.html) to read.
  * How complicated is the code and how large is it?
      * The code base is large and accurate, but for me there is a lack of comments, it is pretty hard to understand.
  * How mature is the project? Is it very new, or has it been around for a long time? Does it have a stable
release yet?
      * The first lines of source code were added to Doxygen in 1999. It has a stable release and can be used in [different ways](http://doxygen.org/index.html).
  * Is the project interesting and/or exciting to you?
      * The idea of the project is both very interesting and exciting for me. However, due to the hard installation process, the additional knowledge I need to get in order to understand what I should do, and not vast enough supportive community, I don't want to contribute to this project.
