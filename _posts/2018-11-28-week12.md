## November 28th

By November 28th, our team has decided to do split into 2 teams. Each team decided to the the following:
  * One team: me and Jimmy, and we are working on the [ant optimization problem](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/issues/3631). 
    * I will start writing the code today and finish it by the end of Saturday. 
    * Jimmy will comment the issue on GitHub (something about "I'm working on this issue"). 
    * Heâ€™ll go through the info about the algorithm and think about the corner cases and various tests and send them to me by the end of Saturday.
  * Another team: Anupam and Amal are working on the [ugly numbers problem](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/issues/3846). 
    * Anupam starts writing the code and tries to finish it by the end of Saturday. 
    * Amal will comment the issue on GitHub (something about "I'm working on this issue").
    * He'll think about the corner cases and various tests and send them to Anupam by the end of Saturday.
