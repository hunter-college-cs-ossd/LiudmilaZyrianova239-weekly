## October 3rd, [Assignment 6](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_06_team_project.pdf):  Collaborative Editing

By October 3rd I've read the chapter in the *Pro Git* book named *Git Branching*. I really like this book mostly because of the clarifying pictures and the multiple examples of each command. So, the text was easy to read and understand. It explains the meaning of each command and the underlying process.

Also, one member of my team created a special channel on Slack to discuss anything concerning the assignment. It was a great decision he made! It was so easy to cooperate and resolve any arising problems such as the order in which we should revise each other repositories. More than that, we discuss there whatever changes we want to accept for each revised repository.

I really enjoy working in such a way.
