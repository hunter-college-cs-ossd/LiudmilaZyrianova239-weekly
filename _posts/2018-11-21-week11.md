## November 21st, [Assignment 12](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_12_bug_fixing.pdf): Bug Triage and Fixing

The bug that I was working on is [#1805357 Indent size must be 2 spaces, not 4](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bash8/+bug/1805357). These are the steps I made to triage it:
  1. I found out that this bug correspond to the project [bash8](https://launchpad.net/bash8), a pep8 equivalent for bash scripts. As it turns out, [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is a style guide for Python code.
  2. Since in order to post a comment I must log in, I've logged in Ubuntu One.
  3. Following the instructions from the [Bug Triage, Chapter 6.7](https://quaid.fedorapeople.org/TOS/Practical_Open_Source_Software_Exploration/html/sn-Debugging_the_Code-Bug_Triage.html), I've posted a comment: 
  > Thanks for reporting, I'll try to reproduce today.
  4. I've looked for other similar bugs on [bash8's bug page](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bash8), and I haven't found any similar bugs.
  5. I've thought about severity and/or priority, and according to the [Bugzilla Triage Guide](https://wiki.gnome.org/Bugsquad/TriageGuide), this bug falls into category "Incorrect strings, typos, etc.". Hence, it's Severity=Trivial, Priority=High.
  6. Obviously, the bug is filed against the correct component, with the correct version, because even in [README.md](https://github.com/openstack-dev/bashate) of bash8 there is a statement:
  > E003: ensure all indents are a multiple of 4 spaces
  7. I read [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guide and found that the guide suggested to:
  > Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
  8. Also, I've googled "indentation in bash script" and found out that there is no sctrict standart for indentation: the bug repoter refers to [Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml#Indentation), which supports 2 spaces. However, more specific [Bash Style Guide and Coding Standard](https://lug.fh-swf.de/vim/vim-bash/StyleGuideShell.en.pdf) supports both 2 and 4 spaces:
  > The indentation of program constructions has to agree with the logic nesting depth. The indentation
  > of one step usually is in line with the tabulator steps of the editor selected. In most cases 2, 4 or 8
  > are chosen.
  9. Since pep8 and Bash Style Guide support 4 spaces, not 2, I've come up with a decision to clarify this problem with bug reporter. So, I've asked him the following question:
  > Thanks for taking the time to report this bug.
  > This bug report is debatable because there are at least two sources claiming that the indent size can be 4. If you have time and can   > still reproduce the bug, please read pep8 (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/bug-HOWTO.html). Since bash8 was built to be equivalent to       > pep8, it could be a good reference to the correct number of spaces. Also, read Bash Style Guide and Coding Standard (https://lug.fh-   > swf.de/vim/vim-bash/StyleGuideShell.en.pdf), which describes the guidelines specifically for bash. It says that both 2 or 4 spaces     > might be used. 
  10. Now I'm waiting for the response from the bug reporter in order to proceed the triage. Most likely that he will agree with me and simply close the issue.
