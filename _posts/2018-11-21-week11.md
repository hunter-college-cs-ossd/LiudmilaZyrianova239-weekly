## November 21st, [Assignment 12](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_12_bug_fixing.pdf): Bug Triage and Fixing

The bug that I was working on is [#1805357 Indent size must be 2 spaces, not 4](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bash8/+bug/1805357). These are the steps I made to triage it:
  1. I found out that this bug correspond to the project [bash8](https://launchpad.net/bash8), a pep8 equivalent for bash scripts. As it turns out, [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is a style guide for Python code.
  2. Since in order to post a comment I must log in, I've logged in Ubuntu One.
  3. Following the instructions from the [Bug Triage, Chapter 6.7](https://quaid.fedorapeople.org/TOS/Practical_Open_Source_Software_Exploration/html/sn-Debugging_the_Code-Bug_Triage.html), I've posted a comment: 
  > Thanks for reporting, I'll try to reproduce today.
  4. I've looked for other similar bugs on [bash8's bug page](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bash8), and I haven't found any similar bugs.
  5. I've thought about severity and/or priority, and according to the [Bugzilla Triage Guide](https://wiki.gnome.org/Bugsquad/TriageGuide), this bug falls into category "Incorrect strings, typos, etc.". Hence, it's Severity=Trivial, Priority=High.
  6. Obviously, the bug is filed against the correct component, with the correct version, because even in [README.md](https://github.com/openstack-dev/bashate) of bash8 there is a statement:
  > E003: ensure all indents are a multiple of 4 spaces
  7. I read [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guide and found that the guide suggested to:
  > Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
  8. Also,
