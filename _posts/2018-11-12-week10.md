## November 16th, [Assignment 11](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_11_project_setup.pdf):   

### Setting Up A Project

Due to the specification of the project I've chosen, [Cosmos - the library of algorithms](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos), it was relatively easy to set it up. 
These are the steps I've made:
  * I've looked through [guides](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/tree/master/guides), and as it turns out, I just need an IDE to be installed.
  * I've forked and cloned the repository to my local machine.
  * I've looked through the issues and found at least 3 of them, which don't have any pull requests and seem interesting and developing our algorithm's knowledge. Here they are:
    * ["Ugly numbers"](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/issues/3846). Is asks for creating a new algorithm for computation of these number.
    * ["Add code for auto encoder"](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/issues/3786). There is an unmerged pull request for this issued, but the code is in Python. So we might to it in C++
    * ["Ant Colony Optimization"](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/issues/3631). I don't understand why this issue is so old. I think we could implement it.
    * Also, there are some interesting issues about AI/Machine Learning labeled as `Hacktoberfest`, so I'm not sure, whether we are allowed to use them. 
  * I've looked through their [discussion board](https://discourse.opengenus.org/). However, the discussion is not very active, I think in the case on this project it is appropriate to rely only on the discussions on GitHub in Issue and Pull Request 
  
### Reading  
Reading was really useful in terms of future applications of the knowledge from the reading because I've been visiting the page for [GitHub flow](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) many times before during work over our previous assignment. But only now, after reading [GitHub Flow by Scott Chacon](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) I've completely realized the reasons for each tip in this instruction.
