## December 12th (To be continued)
### [Assignment 13](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_13_licenses.pdf):  About Software Licenses

* *Copyleft* is the common method to make a programm free software. We do this by firsly stating the it is copyrighted, but then we add the distribution terms (contained, for eample, in the [GNU General Public Licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)) in order to gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program (or any program derived from original one) with the same distribution terms. Thus, the users have freedom, but they cannot make the code a proprietary software, they cannot add restrictions to deny other people the central freedoms.
* There are 4 criteria which help to classify and distinguish GNU Public Licences:
  1. Whether or not it is a free software license (when the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software)
  2. Whether or not it is a copyleft license ( which protects the central freedoms from making it a proprietary software)
  3. Whether or not it is compatible with the GNU GPL (when the users can combine two programms released under the GNU GPL and the other license).
  4. Whether or not it causes any particular practical problems.
* Now I'll some of the licenses:
  1. GNU GPL is a free software license and a copyleft license, which is obviously compatible with the GNU GPL.
  2. Apache License is a free software license, which is compatible with the GNU GPL Version 3, but not with Version 2, because of some requirements that are not in that GPL version. Namely, it is a certain patent termination and indemnification provisions.
  3. Mozilla Public License (MPL)

### Project work
By December 9th we've finally finished the contribution to our project. We reviewed the structiral guidlines of OpenGenuses, followed them, compared our input/output with already ecxisting programms, tested the code againg. Even though I've wrote the initial code for ant optimization algorithm, and Jimmy thought about the tests and improved the code, we decided that Jimmy would make a pull request, because he's already replied to the issue.
