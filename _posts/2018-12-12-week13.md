### [Assignment 13](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_13_licenses.pdf):  About Software Licenses

* *Copyleft* is the common method to make a programm free software. We do this by firsly stating the it is copyrighted, but then we add the distribution terms (contained, for eample, in the [GNU General Public Licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)) in order to gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program (or any program derived from original one) with the same distribution terms. Thus, the users have freedom, but they can't make the code proprietary software.

### Project work
By December 9th we've finally finished the contribution to our project. We reviewed the structiral guidlines of OpenGenuses, followed them, compared our input/output with already ecxisting programms, tested the code againg. Even though I've wrote the initial code for ant optimization algorithm, and Jimmy thought about the tests and improved the code, we decided that Jimmy would make a pull request, because he's already replied to the issue.
