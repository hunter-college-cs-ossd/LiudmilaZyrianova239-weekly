## October 22nd, [Assignment 9](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_09_bug_trackers.pdf): Bug Trackers

The assignment was focusing on (GNOME's Bugzilla bug tracker)[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=GNOME%20Accessibility%20Bugs]. I've noticed that this project has a relatively small community, which is concentrating mostly on one product. When I opened this website for the first time, it was hard for me to find any information needed for the assignment. I was searching through their huge official documentation, trying to find something. But as it turns out, almost all of the needed information was under `Report` link. So, it was a strange designer decision to put all of the explanatory information needed for newbie under this unsuitably titled link.
