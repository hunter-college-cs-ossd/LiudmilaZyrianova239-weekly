## October 17th, [Assignment 8](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/cs_ossd/assignments/assignment_08_git_workflow_2.pdf):   A Second Git Workflow Exercise

For me, the hardest part of the assignment was to understand the task. Namely, what should be written in the `main.cpp`. It took me a long time to realize what the final code should do and to get familiar with the syntax. But when it was done, the rest of the task was pretty easy and routine, because I'm already familiar with GitHub, and our team has a good communicational channel on Slack to help each other and coordinate our actions. 
However, it was fun to do all these things, and I was excited about being a part of the teamwork.
